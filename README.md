# hero-fight
Loads heroes from text file, prints the roster, and allows user to select heroes to fight each other.

This was an assignment for ITP 165 Introduction to C++. We were given the StrLib files and the input file, but the rest is my own work. The purpose of the assignment was to practice using pointers, dynamically creating class objects, input and output filestream, and more!
